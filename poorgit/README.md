# PoorGit

PoorGit is a simple git knockoff that I created for educational purposes. It is a command-line tool that mimics some of the basic functionality of git, such as creating repositories, adding files, committing changes, and viewing the history of a repository.

Although PoorGit is not as feature-rich or robust as git, it is a good starting point for learning about version control systems and how they work. By exploring the codebase of PoorGit, you can gain a better understanding of the underlying concepts and principles of version control.

_*DO NOT use PoorGit in any way.*_
